## Scope

This research line focuses on the **igneous petrology and volcanic geochemistry** of the **Revillagigedo Archipelago**, an active ocean-island volcanic province in the eastern Pacific.

Work integrates **field volcanology**, **stratigraphy**, **whole-rock and mineral geochemistry**, and **radiogenic isotopes** to reconstruct eruptive histories and magmatic processes.

## Isla San Benedicto — Bárcena Volcano (1952–1953)

**Focus:** Monogenetic volcanism, hydrovolcanic processes, and short-lived magma evolution during the 1952–53 eruption.

**Methods:**  
- Stratigraphy and pyroclastic facies analysis  
- Whole-rock geochemistry (XRF, ICP-MS)  
- Mineral chemistry (EPMA) and SEM textures  
- Radiogenic isotopes (TIMS; Sr–Nd–Pb)

**Outcome:**  
A comprehensive eruptive and magmatic model for Bárcena Volcano, documenting a **transitional hydrovolcanic–magmatic system** in an ocean-island setting.

## Isla Socorro

**Focus:** Petrological and geochemical characterization of volcanic products from Isla Socorro to place Bárcena within the broader **archipelago-scale magmatic framework**.

**Status:**  
Ongoing and planned analytical work based on existing sample collections.
