## Scope

This research line addresses **explosive silicic volcanism** at the **Los Humeros Volcanic Complex (Mexico)**, integrating stratigraphy, petrology, and geochemistry to understand eruption dynamics and magma evolution.

---

## Xoxoctic Pumice eruption

**Focus:** Stratigraphy and eruptive history of the Plinian eruption that produced the **Xoxoctic Pumice**, with emphasis on magma storage, mixing, and eruption dynamics.

**Methods:**  
- High-resolution stratigraphy of Plinian deposits  
- Whole-rock geochemistry (XRF, ICP-MS)  
- Petrological constraints on magma evolution

**Key output:**
