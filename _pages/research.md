## Overview

My research focuses on **igneous petrology and volcanic geochemistry** of **young volcanic systems**, with emphasis on **ocean-island volcanism** and **explosive silicic volcanism**. I integrate stratigraphy, petrology, geochemistry, and isotopes to reconstruct eruptive histories and magmatic processes.

Current research is organized into two main thematic lines:

---

## Ocean-island volcanism — Revillagigedo Archipelago (Mexico)

Research on the volcanic evolution of the **Revillagigedo Archipelago**, including **Isla San Benedicto** (Bárcena Volcano, 1952–53) and **Isla Socorro**, focused on monogenetic volcanism, magma evolution, and hydrovolcanic processes.

## Explosive volcanism — Los Humeros Volcanic Complex (Mexico)

Research on **Plinian to sub-Plinian explosive eruptions** at the **Los Humeros Volcanic Complex**, with emphasis on the **Xoxoctic Pumice** eruption and magma storage, mixing, and eruption dynamics.
