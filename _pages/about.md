I am a **PhD candidate in Applied Geosciences at IPICYT (Mexico)** specializing in **igneous petrology and volcanic geochemistry** of **young volcanic systems**, with a primary focus on **ocean-island and monogenetic volcanism**.

My doctoral research reconstructs the **eruptive and magmatic evolution of the 1952–53 Bárcena monogenetic cone** (Isla San Benedicto, Revillagigedo Archipelago) through an integrated approach combining stratigraphy, petrology, geochemistry, and radiogenic isotopes.
