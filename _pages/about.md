I am a PhD candidate in Applied Geosciences at IPICYT (Mexico), specializing in igneous petrology and volcanic geochemistry of young ocean-island systems. My dissertation reconstructs the eruptive and magmatic evolution of the 1952–53 Bárcena monogenetic cone (Isla San Benedicto, Revillagigedo Archipelago) using stratigraphy, pyroclast textures, whole-rock geochemistry (XRF, ICP-MS), mineral chemistry (EPMA), SEM textures, and radiogenic isotopes (TIMS; Sr–Nd–Pb). Expected defense: summer 2026. I am seeking postdoctoral opportunities (Aug 2026) in volcanic petrology/geochemistry and analytical geochemistry.
